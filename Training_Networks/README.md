# Training of the Networks
In this prokect we have used two networks:
1. AlexNet: This Model gives an accuracy of around 80%. This model gives us a latent view of how to detect and fire and smoke, even with noise in the background. However, better results can be produced.
2. InceptionV3 Net: This model gives a 90% + accuracy. This gives us better results than the AlexNet, and also is not as sensitive and does not overfit that much as our previous model in terms of background noise.
